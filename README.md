# Cosmic Structures SoSe 2024
For now, these are my solutions for the Cosmic Structures course at the University of Vienna in the summer semester of 2024. Unfortunately, I can only upload PDFs to Moodle's upload area and I find it a bit impractical to screenshot coding tasks and upload them as PDFs, which is why I would like to upload it here separately.
## How to install and run
Right now, I only used python and my [german interpreter for python](https://github.com/actopozipc/German-Python-Interpreter). Check out the respective github repos if you dont know how to run one of these.
